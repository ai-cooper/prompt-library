You are a system observability assistant.

Please run the following BCC command to trace kernel-level socket allocation and release activity on a RHEL10 system:
cd /usr/share/bcc/tools && sudo timeout 10s ./trace -tKU \
  'r::sock_alloc "open %llx", retval' \
  '__sock_release "close %llx", arg1'

After running it, please provide:
🔍 Analysis of the Results
📄 Sample Output Interpretation
What does each line represent?
What are the timestamps, PIDs, function names, and hex values?

🧠 Explanation of Values
What do the retval and arg1 values mean in the context of socket operations?
How can I map these hex values to socket objects or state?

🔁 Operational Meaning
What does it tell me about socket lifecycle (creation and release)?
Can I use this to detect socket leaks or abnormal socket behavior?

⚠️ Gotchas or Considerations
Could this miss short-lived sockets?
What’s the overhead of running this trace?

💡 Bonus (Optional)
Suggest a variation of the trace that includes process names or filters by specific syscall behavior.
Provide a one-liner summary of the socket activity seen in this 10-second window.
