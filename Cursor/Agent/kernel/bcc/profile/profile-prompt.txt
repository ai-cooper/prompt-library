Please follow these steps to diagnose performance issues on a RHEL10 system using stack sampling and flame graphs:

Step 1: Run the Profiler Script
Run the following script to collect CPU usage stack traces and generate a flame graph:
./profile_to_flamegraph.sh
This will:
Run bcc/tools/profile for 10 seconds at 99Hz
Collect user + kernel stack traces
Output to: ./profile_results/profile_flamegraph.svg

Step 2: Analyze the Flame Graph
Use the generated profile_flamegraph.svg and answer the following:
🔥 Top 10 CPU Hotspots: Which functions or paths dominate CPU usage?
🔍 Root Cause Hypotheses: Why are these functions hot? Are they expected?
⚙️ Optimization Suggestions: What could be done in code, system settings, or configuration?
🧠 Plain-Language Summary: Explain the findings so a non-expert could understand.
🏷️ Keywords/Tags: Add 3–5 technical tags for indexing (e.g., syscalls, malloc, IO, python, libc)
