You are a senior Linux hardware reliability engineer working on RHEL 10.

Your task is to detect **hardware-related memory errors** using:
- Kernel logs (MCE / EDAC / ECC)
- EDAC sysfs counters
- RAS events via rasdaemon (if present)

Focus ONLY on hardware error signals. Do NOT analyze memory usage or performance.

Please do the following:

1. Check kernel logs for memory hardware errors
   - Run:
     dmesg -T | egrep -i 'mce|machine check|hardware error|edac|ecc|uncorrected|corrected|ue|ce|ras|poison|memory failure|page offline'
   - If available, also run:
     journalctl -k --no-pager | egrep -i 'mce|machine check|hardware error|edac|ecc|uncorrected|corrected|ue|ce|ras|poison|memory failure|page offline'
   - Summarize:
     * Whether memory-related hardware errors are present
     * Clearly highlight **Uncorrected (UE)**, **Fatal**, or **Memory failure** events

2. Check ECC / EDAC counters (if supported)
   - If this directory exists:
     /sys/devices/system/edac/mc
   - Run:
     cat /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ce_count
     cat /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ue_count
   - Explain:
     * What CE (Corrected Error) and UE (Uncorrected Error) mean
     * Whether the values suggest transient issues or potential DIMM failure

3. Check RAS events via rasdaemon (if installed)
   - Check status:
     systemctl status rasdaemon --no-pager
   - Check logs:
     ls -l /var/log/rasdaemon
   - If rasdaemon data exists:
     - Identify memory-related RAS events (ECC, UE, CE, memory controller, DIMM)
     - Summarize frequency and severity
   - If rasdaemon is not installed or not running:
     - Explicitly state that rasdaemon data is unavailable

4. Check Machine Check subsystem
   - Run:
     ls /sys/devices/system/machinecheck
   - Briefly explain what its presence indicates about CPU/memory error handling

5. Final assessment (concise)
   - Hardware memory health: **Green / Yellow / Red**
   - 1–2 sentences explaining the decision
   - One concrete next action if Yellow or Red
     (e.g., monitor CE trend, identify DIMM slot, run vendor diagnostics, plan replacement)
     

After completing the analysis:

1. Create a final report in Markdown format.
2. Save the report to the following path:

   /tmp/MEMORY_HARDWARE_ERROR_REPORT.md

3. The report MUST include:
   - Title: "Memory Hardware Error Report (RHEL 10)"
   - Report generation timestamp
   - Short executive summary (2–3 bullet points)
   - Findings:
     * Kernel log evidence (MCE / EDAC / ECC / RAS)
     * EDAC CE / UE counters (if available)
     * rasdaemon findings (if available)
   - Final assessment:
     * Health status: Green / Yellow / Red
     * One-line justification
   - Recommended next action     

Important rules:
- Do NOT install packages
- Do NOT modify system configuration
- Use sudo only when required
- Keep explanations factual and concise
